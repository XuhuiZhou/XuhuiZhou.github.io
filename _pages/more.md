I am an incoming PhD student at the [**Language Technologies Institute at CMU**](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) interested in socially intelligent human language technology. 

**Previously**, I interned at [**Apple Machine Intelligence**](https://machinelearning.apple.com/). Before that, I was a CLMS student at the University of Washington (UW) advised by [**Noah Smith**](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). At [**Noah's ARK**](http://www.ark.cs.washington.edu/), I worked with [**Maarten Sap**](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~msap/index.html) and [**Swabha Swayamdipta**](https://swabhs.com/) on social NLP problems; [**Nikolaos 
Pappas**](https://nik0spapp.github.io/) on document-level language understanding. Besides, I also worked with [**Shane Steinert-Threlkeld**](https://www.shane.st/) on the interpretability of NLP models and emergent communication.

I got my bachelor degree in Statistics at Nanjing University (NJU), where I did research in NLP with [**Shujian Huang**](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj/). Previously, I interned 
at Singapore University of Technology and Design and Westlake University working with [**Yue Zhang**](https://frcchang.github.io/). I spent a wonderful junior year at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), where I made up my mind researching language technologies.
