I am a first-year PhD student at the [**Language Technologies Institute at CMU**](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) working with [**Maarten Sap**](http://maartensap.com/)

. I am interested in socially intelligent human language technology. More specifically (yet still vague), I am interested in the following Qs:
<ol class="gradient-list">
  <li>How do we create better (socially) grounded language technology with commonsense?</li>
  <li>How does (social) language intelligence emerge through human language communication?</li>
  <li>How do we define and build language technology that interacts with humans/society positively?</li>
</ol>
