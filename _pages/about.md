I am an incoming PhD student in the [**School of Interactive Computing**](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech:bee:,
where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [**Diyi Yang**](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/index.html). I am interested in socially intelligent human language technology.  

Specifically, I focus on how to enable NLP to better navigate social contexts. Nowadays, NLP models are strong in terms of benchmark performance.
However, they produce hatespeech, contain social biases, behave undesiredly, and etc., which hurt, divide, and disappoint people.

**Previously**, I interned at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) as Machine Learning Engineer. I was a CLMS student at the University of Washington (UW) advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). I got my bachelor 
degree in Statistics at Nanjing University (NJU).
