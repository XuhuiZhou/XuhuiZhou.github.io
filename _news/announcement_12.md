Really excited about our newly-accepted EMNLP papers:! [Don't Take This Out of Context! On the Need for Contextual Models and Evaluations for Stylistic Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14755), [FANTOM: A Benchmark for Analyzing Theory of Mind in Conversations](https://coming-soon), and our MRL workshop paper: [Learning to translate by learning to communicate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07025)
